# Dual Compatibility Clap Button (clap_button_message)

This example shows an alternate method for achieving dual compatibility: Make an
extension that is compatible with both JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook by exporting
multiple plugins and using "required" features to select different behaviors. Adds a clap button to
the top area (in JupyterLab) or the right sidebar (Jupyter Notebook). This example is part
of the [Extension Dual Compatibility Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension_dual_compatibility.html).
